{"text": "Background: The 5-year survival rate of multiple myeloma (MM) in China is less than 40%, with considerable individual heterogeneity. Gene mutations are important predictive biomarkers that influence MM treatment decision. The aim of our study was to uncover the clinical significance of mutated genes in MM in the Chinese population. \\n Methods: Targeted exon panel sequencing was performed of 400 genes to detect the gene mutation status in plasma cells from 50 patients with MM. DAVID was used to explore the functions and pathways of mutated genes. Detection of mutant gene expression, prognosis and immune cell infiltration with GSE6477. GEO2R was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kaplan-Meier and CIBERSORT were applied to compare survival distributions and evaluate the gene expression associated with immune cell infiltration, respectively. \\n Results: Mutations of 337 genes were identified in MM. The mutation types included SNP, INS, and DEL, but the dominant mutation type was SNP. Function and pathway analysis of mutant genes were performed to elucidate DNA modifications. We identified a total number of 660 downregulated and 587 upregulated genes from the GSE6477 dataset. Thirty-three common genes were present in both the mutant genes and DEGs. The functions and pathways of the mutated genes were enriched in myeloid cell differentiation, regulation of hemopoiesis, etc. Moreover, we found that the low expression of BCL6, BIRC3, HLA-DQA1, and VCAN was correlated with poor prognosis in MM. \\n Conclusions: The mutations and low expression of BCL6, BIRC3, HLA-DQA1, and VCAN were correlated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration in MM. This study is the first to reveal the spectrum of mutations in the Chinese population by the use of an NGS panel.", "ideal": {"GENE, FUNCTION, DISEASE": ""}, "task": 1}
{"text": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-1 protein. Recent genetic correlational studies have implicated DNA damage repair pathways in modifying the age at onset of disease symptoms in SCA1 and Huntington's Disease, another polyglutamine expansion disease. We demonstrate that both endogenous and transfected ataxin-1 localizes to sites of DNA damage, which is impaired by polyglutamine expansion. This response is dependent on ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Further, we characterize an ATM phosphorylation motif within ataxin-1 at serine 188. We show reduction of the Drosophila ATM homolog levels in a ATXN1[82Q] Drosophila model through shRNA or genetic cross ameliorates motor symptoms. These findings offer a possible explanation as to why DNA repair was implicated in SCA1 pathogenesis by past studies. The similarities between the ataxin-1 and the huntingtin responses to DNA damage provide further support for a shared pathogenic mechanism for polyglutamine expansion diseases.", "ideal": {"GENE, FUNCTION, DISEASE": ""}, "task": 1}
{"text": "The role of sarcosine metabolism in prostate cancer progression. Metabolomic profiling of prostate cancer (PCa) progression identified markedly elevated levels of sarcosine (N-methyl glycine) in metastatic PCa and modest but significant elevation of the metabolite in PCa urine. Here, we examine the role of key enzymes associated with sarcosine metabolism in PCa progression. Consistent with our earlier report, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PCa urine sediments compared to controls, with a modest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7In addition, the expression of sarcosine biosynthetic enzyme, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), was elevated in PCa tissues, while sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and pipecolic acid oxidase (PIPOX), which metabolize sarcosine, were reduced in prostate tumors. Consistent with this, GNMT promoted the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by facilitating sarcosine production, while SARDH and PIPOX reduced the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by metabolizing sarcosine. Accordingly, addition of sarcosine, but not glycine or alanine, induced invasion and intravasation in an in vivo PCa model. In contrast, GNMT knockdown or SARDH overexpression in PCa xenografts inhibited tumor growth. Taken together, these studies substantiate the role of sarcosine in PCa progression.", "ideal": {"GENE, FUNCTION, DISEASE": ""}, "task": 1}

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate predictive and prognostic significance of microtubule-associated protein Tau in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: 74 patients with EOC (stage I-IV) who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by standard paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy were included in the retrospective analysis. Their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were immunohistochemically stained for Tau protein, using semi-quantitative DAKO test. Tau expression was acknowledged as negative (0 and 1+) or positive (2+ and 3+). The correlation between Tau expression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meyer estimator, long rank test, Mann Whitney test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: 25.7% (19/74) and 74.3% (55/74) of the patients were classified as Tau-negative and Tau-positive, respectively. Median PFS was 28.7 months for Tau-negative group and 15.9 months for Tau-positive group (p = 0.0355). In the univariate analysis 3-year OS in Tau-negative and Tau-positive groups was 80.2% and 52.4%, respectively (p = 0.0198). Low expression of protein Tau was associated with better OS, whereas an advanced stage at diagnosis, suboptimal surgery, serous histological type and resistance to first line chemotherapy were each correlated with worse OS (p <0,05). In multivariate analysis only resistance to first line chemotherapy remained significant (HR 22.59; 95% CI, 8.71-58.55; p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Negative tau protein seems to be both good prognostic factor and a predictor of response to paclitaxel/platinum-based chemotherapy in EOC patients.", "ideal": {"GENE, FUNCTION, DISEASE": ""}, "task": 1}
{"text": "Cancer stem-like cell marker CD44 promotes bone metastases by enhancing tumorigenicity, cell motility, and hyaluronan production. CD44, an adhesion molecule that binds to the extracellular matrix, primarily to hyaluronan (HA), has been implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. CD44 has also recently been recognized as a marker for stem cells of several types of cancer. However, the roles of CD44 in the development of bone metastasis are unclear. Here, we addressed this issue by using bone metastatic cancer cell lines, in which CD44 was stably knocked down. Tumor sphere formation and cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited by CD44 knockdown. Furthermore, the downregulation of CD44 markedly suppressed tumorigenicity and bone metastases in nude mice. Of note, the number of osteoclasts decreased in the bone metastases. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of HA synthase 2 was downregulated in CD44-knockdown cells. The localization of HA in the bone metastatic tumors was also markedly reduced. We then examined the roles of CD44-HA interaction in bone metastasis using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of HA synthesis. 4-MU decreased tumor sphere and osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. Moreover, 4-MU inhibited bone metastases in vivo with reduced number of osteoclasts. These results collectively suggest that CD44 expression in cancer cells promotes bone metastases by enhancing tumorigenicity, cell migration and invasion, and HA production. Our results also suggest the possible involvement of CD44-expressing cancer stem cells in the development of bone metastases through interaction with HA. CD44-HA interaction could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for bone metastases.", "ideal": {"GENE, FUNCTION, DISEASE": ""}, "task": 1}
{"text": "Nonequivalent gene expression and copy number alterations in high-grade serous ovarian cancers with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. PURPOSE: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) accounts for the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer deaths. Genomic and functional data suggest that approximately half of unselected HGSC have disruption of the BRCA pathway and defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR). Pathway disruption is regarded as imparting a BRCAness phenotype. We explored the molecular changes in HGSC arising in association with specific BRCA1/BRCA2 somatic or germline mutations and in those with BRCA1 DNA promoter methylation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We describe gene expression and copy number analysis of two large cohorts of HGSC in which both germline and somatic inactivation of HRR has been measured. RESULTS: BRCA1 disruptions were associated with the C2 (immunoreactive) molecular subtype of HGSC, characterized by intense intratumoral T-cell infiltration. We derived and validated a predictor of BRCA1 mutation or methylation status, but could not distinguish BRCA2 from wild-type tumors. DNA copy number analysis showed that cases with BRCA1 mutation were significantly associated with amplification both at 8q24 (frequencies: BRCA1 tumors 50%, BRCA2 tumors 32%, and wild-type tumors 9%) and regions of the X-chromosome specifically dysregulated in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC; BRCA1 62%, BRCA2 34%, and wild-type 35%). Tumors associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations shared a negative association with amplification at 19p13 (BRCA1 0%, BRCA2 3%, and wild-type 20%) and 19q12 (BRCA1 6%, BRCA2 3%, and wild-type 29%).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary arteriolar small-vessel disease caused by Notch3 mutations. A detailed definition of the neuro-ophthalmologic spectrum of CADASIL might provide new insights in the pathophysiology of small-vessel diseases. Therefore, this study aims to precisely delineate the features and the prevalence of the visual system impairment in CADASIL. METHODS: A cohort of 34 genetically confirmed CADASIL patients was enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study. Subjects underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation. Clinical features and common cardiovascular risk factors were also considered. Data were compared with those already reported in previous studies. RESULTS: Both afferent and efferent visual structures were commonly impaired in CADASIL patients. Retinal microvascular changes such as arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking, described in most patients and detected also in asymptomatic carriers, reflect the typical hemodynamic changes of CADASIL. However, less frequent findings, like early macular and lens changes, would indicate a possible further role played by susceptibility to premature aging and degeneration. Cotton wool spots and vessel occlusions were not common. Finally, eye movement abnormalities suggest that the brainstem is particularly vulnerable to damage in CADASIL. CONCLUSIONS: Although no specific or prominent neuro-ophthalmologic finding can be considered as hallmark of the disease, afferent and efferent visual system abnormalities could be accounted as complementary markers to study cerebral small-vessel diseases.", "ideal": {"GENE, FUNCTION, DISEASE": ""}, "task": 1}

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have focused on the association between miR-34 family members, which are direct p53 targets, and carcinogenesis of many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess whether polymorphisms in the single-nucleotide polymorphism miR-34b/c T>C (rs4938723) and TP53 Arg72Pro (rs1042522) increase the risk of HCC and influence outcome in patients with HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 157 HCC patients and 201 cancer-free control subjects from the Korean population. MicroRNA polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: We found that the miR-34b/c TC+CC frequency was significantly higher in HCC patients than in controls (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.580; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.029-2.426). The miR-34b/c CC-TP53 Arg/Arg combination significantly increased the risk of HCC (AOR: 13.644; 95% CI: 1.451-128.301). The SNPs miR-34b/c T>C and TP53 Arg72Pro(G>C) had no influence on survival of HCC patients.

PURPOSE: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare but potentially deadly tumor of the eye. Despite effective local therapies, recurrence and metastasis remain frequent. Once the tumor has metastasized, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor. To date, little is known of the genetic alterations in conjunctival melanomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted genetic analysis of 78 conjunctival melanomas, to our knowledge the largest cohort reported to date. An oncogene hotspot array was run on 38 samples, screening for a panel of known cancer-relevant mutations. Thirty tumors were analyzed for genome-wide copy number alterations (CNA) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Sanger sequencing of selected target mutations was conducted in all samples. RESULTS: BRAF mutations were identified in 23 of 78 (29%) tumors. NRAS mutations, previously not recognized as relevant in conjunctival melanoma, were detected in 14 of 78 (18%) tumors. We found CNAs affecting various chromosomes distributed across the genome in a pattern reminiscent of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but differing markedly from uveal melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of NRAS or BRAF mutations in a mutually exclusive pattern in roughly half (47%) of conjunctival melanomas and the pattern of CNAs argue for conjunctival melanoma being closely related to cutaneous and mucosal melanoma but entirely distinct from uveal melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cocaine and opioid codependent (DSM-IV) patients were stabilized on methadone and subsequently randomized into treatment groups - disulfiram (250 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=37). They were genotyped for ANKK1 (rs1800497) and DRD2 (rs2283265) polymorphisms, and the data were evaluated for an association between a cocaine-free state, as assessed by cocaine-free urine samples, and disulfiram treatment.

RESULTS: Patients with CT or TT ANKK1 genotypes dropped from 80 to 52% cocaine-positive urines on disulfiram (N=13; P\ufffd\ufffd0.0001), whereas those on placebo (N=20) showed no treatment effect. Patients carrying the CC ANKK1 genotype showed no effect on treatment with disulfiram (N=18) or placebo (N=17).

However, there are no studies that have yet evaluated the interaction effect between serotonergic genes and separation life events for panic disorder. METHODS: For this study, 194 panic disorder patients and 172 healthy controls were included for genotyping and environmental factor analysis.

VEXAS syndrome is characterized by a high mortality rate and significant clinical heterogeneity. We sought to determine independent predictors of survival in VEXAS and to understand the mechanistic basis for these factors. We analyzed 83 patients with somatic pathogenic variants in UBA1 at p.Met41 (p.Met41Leu/Thr/Val), the start codon for translation of the cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1 (UBA1b). Patients with the p.Met41Val genotype were most likely to have an undifferentiated inflammatory syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed ear chondritis was associated with increased survival, whereas transfusion dependence and the p.Met41Val variant were independently associated with decreased survival. Using in vitro models and patient-derived cells, we demonstrate that p.Met41Val variant supports less UBA1b translation than either p.Met41Leu or p.Met41Thr, providing a molecular rationale for decreased survival. In addition, we show that these 3 canonical VEXAS variants produce more UBA1b than any of the 6 other possible single-nucleotide variants within this codon. Finally, we report a patient, clinically diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome, with 2 novel mutations in UBA1 occurring in cis on the same allele. One mutation (c.121 A>T; p.Met41Leu) caused severely reduced translation of UBA1b in a reporter assay, but coexpression with the second mutation (c.119 G>C; p.Gly40Ala) rescued UBA1b levels to those of canonical mutations.

Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol.

Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine-synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium, prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol. These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems. Alternatively, activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "Barium-supplemented Long-Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium (100 micrograms/ml mineral fortified water) treatment. Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability, contractility, and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium-induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system. The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital. Under barbiturate anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats. The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response. Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed. The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium-treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen. Similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity. In addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium-exposed rats. Overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure. These experimental findings represent the first indication that life-long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) overdose can cause severe hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death. We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA-induced hypertension. Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA. PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic). Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure. Left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min). Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects. Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5). We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output. That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine. This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model. Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections; five controls received saline only. After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (CC) intravenously. At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls. Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to \"mesangial overloading.\"", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found. Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice. The binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, trypsin or heat. Thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Recently, p-aminophenol (PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats. The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined. BNPP (1 to 8 mM) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity. This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg. BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the BNPP-induced reduction in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation. It is concluded that PAP formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for APAP-induced renal tubular necrosis.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}

{"abstract": "Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV). Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. The difference in the effects of the two was significant. After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}
{"abstract": "This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy. The majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years. It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy. The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month. The mean treatment period was 18 months. During the follow-up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography. Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia. Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}

All others received cyclosporine and prednisone. The randomized Aza patients had more overall infections (P less than 0.05) and more nonviral infections (P less than 0.02) than the randomized cyclosporine patients. Heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the Aza renal patients. There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or Aza, but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths. Renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias. Analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients, intrathoracic infections in heart patients, and urinary tract infections in renal patients.

Experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments revealed that the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule. The analogues CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS (dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg) and caerulein dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves, with the greatest maximum inhibition for CCK-8-NS. The peptide CCK-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides, 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug, diazepam, totally prevented picrotoxin-induced seizures and mortality. The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam. Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK-8-SE.

{"abstract": "The role of vasopressin as a pressor agent to the hypertensive process was examined. Vasopressin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hypertension, since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with lithium-treated diabetes insipidus after DOCA-salt treatment. Administration of DDAVP which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasopressor effect failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of AVP. Furthermore, the pressor action of vasopressin appears to be important in the development of this model of hypertension, since the enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of hypertension. Increased secretion of vasopressin from neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in hypertension. An unproportional release of vasopressin compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin II forming and receptor binding capacity for sodium balance in the brain. However, the role of vasopressin remains to be determined in human essential hypertension.", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}

{"abstract": "Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen.

In vitro perfusion of bepridil in the life-support medium for isolated sino-atrial tissue from rabbit heart, caused a reduction in action potential (AP) spike frequency (recorded by KCl microelectrodes) starting at doses of 5 X 10(-6) M. This effect was dose-dependent up to concentrations of 5 X 10(-5) M, whereupon blockade of sinus activity set in. Bepridil at a dose of 5 X 10(-6) M, induced a concomitant reduction in AP amplitude (falling from 71 +/- 8 mV to 47 +/- 6 mV), maximum systolic depolarization velocity (phase 0) which fell from 1.85 +/- 0.35 V/s to 0.84 +/- 0.28 V/s, together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity (phase 4) which fell from 38 +/- 3 mV/s to 24 +/- 5 mV/s. In vivo injection of bepridil at a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.v.) into 6 anaesthetized dogs which had undergone ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply, together with a bilateral medullo-adrenalectomy, caused a marked reduction in heart rate which fell from 98.7 +/- 4.2 beats/min to 76 +/- 5.3 beats/min sustained for more than 45 min. It is concluded that bepridil reduces heart rate by acting directly on the sinus node. This effect, which results in a flattening of the phase 0 and phase 4 slope, together with a longer AP duration, may be due to an increase in the time constants of slow inward ionic currents (already demonstrated elsewhere), but also to an increased time constant for deactivation of the outward potassium current (Ip).", "ideal": {"chemical, disease": ""}, "task": 2}

Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped.

{"abstract": "In normal rats, the media of small arteries (0.4--0.2 mm in diameter) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles, identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. The hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested. In the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch, vasoconstriction induced by L-norepinephrine produced many cell-to-cell hernias within 15 minutes. At 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number. By 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal. Triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media. These findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function.

The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom, together with a review of clinical records. The risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed TMP-SMZ (5.2/100,000) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone (3.8/100,000). The risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower (2.0/100,000). Only five patients experienced blood disorders, one of whom was exposed to TMP-SMZ; of seven with erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, four were exposed to TMP-SMZ. The one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin. Finally, only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred, none likely to be caused by a study drug.

The aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of misoprostol was dose-dependent. Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular sodium and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of indomethacin and various doses of misoprostol. The 200-micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of indomethacin, whereas the 800-micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and sodium retention. These changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base-line levels thereafter. These results suggest that the renal protective effects of misoprostol is dose-dependent.

An introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac dysrhythmias. All patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme hypotension and dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output. These patients had a second event of cardiac arrest, resulting in death, within 10 to 60 minutes. In one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (81 to 120 mg/m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses (5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg) administered before chemotherapy. Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed. Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes. RESULTS: After granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, a major response (< or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea (P = .0015) and vomiting (P = .0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group. As granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased (P = .040). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (20%). CONCLUSION: A single 10-, 20-, or 40-micrograms/kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57% to 60% of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg/m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40% to 47% of patients.

DISCUSSION: An adverse interaction between clonidine and verapamil has not been reported previously. We describe two such cases and discuss the various mechanisms that might cause such an interaction. Clinicians should be acquainted with this possibly fatal interaction between two commonly used antihypertensive drugs.

The viral protease inhibitor ritonavir is of particular concern since it both inhibits and induces the activity of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms.METHODS: The inhibitory effect of ritonavir on the metabolism of alprazolam, a CYP3A-mediated reaction in humans, was tested in vitro using human liver microsomes. In a double-blind clinical study, volunteer subjects received 1.0 mg of alprazolam concurrent with low-dose ritonavir (four doses of 200 mg) or with placebo.RESULTS: Ritonavir was a potent in vitro inhibitor of alprazolam hydroxylation. The 50% inhibitory concentration was 0.11 micromol/L (0.08 microg/mL); this is below the usual therapeutic plasma concentration range (generally exceeding 2 microg/mL). In the clinical study, ritonavir reduced alprazolam clearance to 41% of control values (P < .001), prolonged elimination half-life (mean values, 30 versus 13 hours; P < .005), and magnified benzodiazepine agonist effects such as sedation and performance impairment.CONCLUSION: Consistent with in vitro results, administration of low doses of ritonavir for a short duration of time resulted in large impairment of alprazolam clearance and enhancement of clinical effects. Removal from product labeling of a warning against coadministration of ritonavir and alprazolam was based on a previous study only of extended exposure to ritonavir, in which CYP3A induction offset inhibition. Kinetic interactions involving antiretroviral therapies may be complex and time dependent. Product labeling should reflect this complexity. 10801241  2.

Subjects ingested single 1.0 mg dose of alprazolam or 0.5 mg doses of triazolam on two occasions, with and without concurrent administration of cimetidine (300 mg) every 6 h. For alprazolam, which has a low hepatic clearance and low extraction ratio, cimetidine significantly impaired total metabolic clearance (1.05 versus 1.66 ml/min/kg, P less than 0.005), resulting in significantly prolonged elimination half-life (16.6 versus 12.4 h, P less than 0.005). For triazolam, which has higher hepatic clearance and an intermediate extraction ratio, total clearance was reduced by cimetidine (3.9 versus 5.9 ml/min/kg), causing a significant increase in total area under the plasma concentration curve (25 versus 38 ng/ml X h, P less than 0.02). However, elimination half-life of triazolam was not influenced by cimetidine (3.3 versus 3.2 h), indicating that the reduction in clearance was manifested as increased systemic availability. Thus, cimetidine impairs the clearance of both alprazolam and triazolam, but the consequences of the kinetic change are different because of the differing hepatic extraction profiles of the two drugs. 6137021  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Each volunteer received 400 mg erythromycin or matched placebo given orally three times a day for 10 days and an oral dose (0.8 mg) of alprazolam on the posttreatment day 8. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 hours after the administration, and psychomotor function was assessed at each time of blood samplings with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visual analog scale, and Udvalg for kliniske unders\u00f8gelser side effect rating scale.RESULTS: Erythromycin significantly (p < 0.001) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (200 +/- 43 versus 322 +/- 49 ng . hr/ml from 0 to 48 hours and 229 +/- 52 versus 566 +/- 161 ng . hr/ml from 0 hour to infinity), decreased the apparent oral clearance (1.02 +/- 0.31 versus 0.41 +/- 0.12 ml/min/kg), and prolonged the elimination half-life (16.0 +/- 4.5 versus 40.3 +/- 14.4 hours) of alprazolam.

Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant that has not yet been fully evaluated with respect to its potential for cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated drug interactions in vivo. Building on the existing in vitro and in vivo evidence that suggest a minimal effect of citalopram on cytochrome P450 3A4, we hypothesized that therapeutic doses of citalopram (20 mg/d), as compared with fluoxetine (20 mg/d), would cause less impairment in the metabolism of the probe drug alprazolam (1 mg) through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme as measured by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in vivo. We found that fluoxetine prolonged the half-life of alprazolam by 16% and increased the area under the curve 0-infinity of alprazolam by 32%, while citalopram did not affect these parameters, although the time of maximum concentration of alprazolam was prolonged by 30 minutes after citalopram administration. Neither selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor significantly affected the pharmacodynamic profile of alprazolam.

The increased plasma concentrations of alprazolam resulted in significantly greater reductions in psychomotor performance evident on day 10. Mean fluvoxamine plasma concentrations were about 25% lower in those who took the combination than in those who took only fluvoxamine; this was more likely due to heterogeneity between the treatment groups than to an effect of alprazolam. The dosage of alprazolam should be reduced during co-administration with fluvoxamine. 8005185  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Ten healthy male subjects receiving itraconazole 200 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 6 days took an oral 0.8 mg dose of alprazolam on day 4 of each treatment phase. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing, together with the assessment of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale and Udvalg for kliniske unders\u00f8gelser side effect rating scale. Itraconazole significantly (P < 0.01) increased the area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity (252 +/- 47 versus 671 +/- 205 ng h/ml), decreased the apparent oral clearance (0.89 +/- 0.21 versus 0.35+/-0.10 ml/min per kg) and prolonged the elimination half-life (15.7 +/- 4.1 versus 40.3 +/- 13.5 h) of alprazolam. The test performed during itraconazole treatment showed significantly depressed psychomotor function. It is suggested that itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases plasma concentration of alprazolam via its inhibitory effects on alprazolam metabolism. Thus, this study supports previous studies suggesting that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of alprazolam. Enhanced side effects of alprazolam by itraconazole coadministration were probably reflected by these pharmacokinetic changes. 9784084  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

This study addresses the potential of 4 diverse antidepressants (venlafaxine, nefazodone, sertraline, and fluoxetine) to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. In a 4-way crossover design, 16 subjects received clinically relevant doses of venlafaxine, nefazodone, or sertraline for 8 days or fluoxetine for 11 days. Treatments were separated by a 7- to 14-day washout period and fluoxetine was always the last antidepressant taken. CYP3A4 activity was evaluated for each subject at baseline and following each antidepressant using the erythromycin breath test (EBT) and by the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam (ALPZ) after 2-mg dose of oral ALPZ. Compared to baseline, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine caused no apparent inhibition or induction of erythromycin metabolism (P > 0.05). For nefazodone, a statistically significant inhibition was observed (P < 0.0005). Nefazodone was also the only antidepressant that caused a significant change in ALPZ disposition, decreasing its area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC; P < 0.01), and increasing its elimination half-life (16.4 vs. 12.3 hours; P < 0.05) compared with values at baseline. No significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of ALPZ with any of the other antidepressants tested. These results demonstrate in vivo that, unlike nefazodone, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine do not possess significant metabolic inductive or inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. 14709940  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

One trial was a control; for the other, subjects ingested propoxyphene, 65 mg every 6 h, for the duration of the benzodiazepine study. The kinetics of each benzodiazepine were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured following each dose. For diazepam, propoxyphene produced a small and statistically insignificant prolongation of elimination half-life (43 vs 38 h) and reduction of total clearance (0.41 vs 0.47 ml min-1 kg-1). Propoxyphene significantly prolonged alprazolam half-life (18 vs 12 h, P less than 0.005) and reduced total clearance (0.8 vs 1.3 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.005). Propoxyphene had no apparent influence on lorazepam half-life (13.4 vs 13.5 h) or clearance (1.5 vs 1.4 ml min-1 kg-1). Thus propoxyphene significantly impairs the clearance of alprazolam, biotransformed mainly by the oxidative reaction of aliphatic hydroxylation. Propoxyphene has far less effect on the oxidation of diazepam by N-demethylation, and has no apparent influence on lorazepam conjugation.

The potential of duloxetine to inhibit CYP1A2 activity was determined using incubations with human liver microsomes and phenacetin, the CYP1A2 substrate. The potential for duloxetine to induce CYP1A2 activity was determined using human primary hepatocytes treated with duloxetine for 72 hours. Studies in humans were conducted using fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, and theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, as probes. The subjects were healthy men and women aged 18-65 years. Single-dose duloxetine was administered either intravenously as a 10-mg infusion over 30 minutes or orally as a 60-mg dose in the presence or absence of steady-state fluvoxamine (100 mg orally once daily). Single-dose theophylline was given as 30-minute intravenous infusions of aminophylline 250 mg in the presence or absence of steady-state duloxetine (60 mg orally twice daily). Plasma concentrations of duloxetine, its metabolites and theophylline were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods and evaluated using mixed-effects ANOVA. Safety measurements included vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, a physical examination, ECG readings and adverse event reports.RESULTS: The in vitro results indicated that duloxetine is metabolized by CYP1A2; however, duloxetine was predicted not to be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2 in humans. Following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the duloxetine area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and the maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)) significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In the presence of fluvoxamine, the oral bioavailability of duloxetine increased from 42.8% to 81.9%. In the presence of duloxetine, the theophylline AUC(infinity) and C(max) increased by only 13% (90% CI 7, 18) and 7% (90% CI 2, 14), respectively. Coadministration of duloxetine with fluvoxamine or theophylline did not result in any clinically important safety concerns, and these combinations were generally well tolerated.CONCLUSION: Duloxetine is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2; therefore, coadministration of duloxetine with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided. Duloxetine does not seem to be a clinically significant inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2; therefore, dose adjustment of CYP1A2 substrates may not be necessary when they are coadministered with duloxetine. 18307373  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

University Road, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5250, USA. skinner@lilly.comBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Duloxetine, a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine currently undergoing clinical investigation for treatment of depression and stress urinary incontinence, has the potential to act as both a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6). Our objectives were to determine the effect of duloxetine on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant metabolized by CYP2D6 (study 1), and the effect of paroxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, on duloxetine pharmacokinetics (study 2).METHODS: Subjects were healthy men and women between 21 and 63 years old. All subjects were genotypically CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In study 1, 50 mg of desipramine was administered as a single dose alone and in the presence of steady-state duloxetine 60 mg twice daily. In study 2, steady-state pharmacokinetics of duloxetine 40 mg once daily were determined in the presence and absence of steady-state paroxetine 20 mg once daily.RESULTS: Duloxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of desipramine 1.7-fold and the area under the concentration-time curve 2.9-fold. Paroxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of duloxetine and the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state 1.6-fold. Reports of adverse events were similar whether duloxetine was administered alone or in combination with desipramine or paroxetine.CONCLUSION: Duloxetine 60 mg twice daily is a moderately potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, intermediate between paroxetine and sertraline. The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine has a moderate effect on duloxetine concentrations. The results of these 2 studies suggest that caution should be used when CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors are coadministered with duloxetine. 12621382  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Plasma concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HM were measured on day 5. Adverse events, clinical safety laboratory data and vital signs were assessed during the study.RESULTS: Duloxetine increased the AUC(tau,ss) of tolterodine by 71%[geometric mean, 95% confidence interval (CI) 31, 123], and its C(max,ss) by 64% (CI 30, 106), and prolonged its t(1/2) by 14% (CI 1, 28).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential interactions between duloxetine and the two CYP2D6 substrates risperidone and aripiprazole in psychiatric patients. Serum concentration data from patients treated with risperidone (n = 8) or aripiprazole (n = 7) in combination with duloxetine were retrieved from therapeutic drug monitoring files at the Center for Psychopharmacology, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2002 May;71(5):403; author reply 403.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nefazodone inhibits CYP3A; therefore coadministration with CYP3A substrates such as terfenadine or loratadine may result in increased exposure to these drugs. A potential pharmacodynamic consequence is electrocardiographic QTc prolongation, which has been associated with torsade de pointes cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore a clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation of this potential interaction was conducted.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multiple-dose design was used. Healthy men and women who were given doses of 60 mg of terfenadine every 12 hours, 20 mg of loratadine once daily, and 300 mg of nefazodone every 12 hours were studied. Descriptive pharmacokinetics (time to maximum concentration, maximum concentration, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve) were used for the examination of interactions among the respective parent drugs and metabolites. QTc prolongation (mean value over the dosing interval) was the pharmacodynamic parameter measured. Kinetic and dynamic analysis was used for the examination of pooled concentration and QTc data with the use of a linear model.RESULTS: Concomitant nefazodone treatment markedly increased the dose interval area under the plasma concentration-time curve of both terfenadine (mean value, 17.3 +/- 8.5 ng. mL/h versus 97.4 +/- 48.9 ng. mL/h; P <.001) and carboxyterfenadine (mean value, 1.69 +/- 0.48 microg. h/mL versus 2.88 +/- 0.53 microg. h/mL; P <.001) and moderately increased the dose interval area under the plasma concentration-time curve of both loratadine (mean value, 31.5 +/- 27.9 ng. h/mL versus 43.7 +/- 25.9 ng. h/mL; P <.014) and descarboethoxyloratadine (mean value, 73.4 +/- 54.9 ng. h/mL versus 81.9 +/- 26.2 ng. h/mL; P <.002). The mean QTc was unchanged with terfenadine alone; however, it was markedly prolonged with concomitant nefazodone and terfenadine (mean [90% confidence interval] prolongation 42.4 ms [34.2, 50.6 ms]; P <.05). Similarly, the mean QTc was unchanged with loratadine alone; however, it was prolonged with concomitant nefazodone and loratadine (21.6 ms [13.7, 29.4 ms]; P <.05). Nefazodone alone did not change mean QTc. QTc was positively correlated with terfenadine plasma concentration (r (2) = 0.21; P =.0001). Similarly, QTc was positively correlated with loratadine plasma concentration (r (2) = 0.056; P =.0008) but with a flatter slope. There was no relationship between QTc and nefazodone plasma concentration during treatment with nefazodone alone (r (2) = 0.002, not significant).CONCLUSIONS: In healthy men and women, concomitant nefazodone treatment at a therapeutic dose increases exposure to both terfenadine and carboxyterfenadine. This increased exposure is associated with marked QTc prolongation, which is correlated with terfenadine plasma concentration. A similar interaction occurs with loratadine, although it is of lesser magnitude. Concomitant administration of nefazodone with terfenadine may have predisposed individuals to the arrhythmia associated with QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, when terfenadine was available for clinical use. However, a new finding is that in the context of higher than clinically recommended daily doses (20 mg) of loratadine concomitant administration with a metabolic inhibitor such as nefazodone can also result in QTc prolongation. 11240972  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

In each study, subjects received three 10 day treatments in random sequence, separated by a 14 day washout period. The treatments were loratadine alone, cimetidine or ketoconazole alone, or loratadine plus cimetidine or ketoconazole. The primary study endpoint was the difference in mean QTc intervals from baseline to day 10. In addition, plasma concentrations of loratadine, DCL, and ketoconazole or cimetidine were obtained on day 10.RESULTS: Concomitant administration of loratadine and ketoconazole significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (307%; 90% CI 205-428%) and DCL concentrations (73%; 62-85%) compared with administration of loratadine alone. Concomitant administration of loratadine and cimetidine significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (103% increase; 70-142%) but not DCL concentrations (6% increase; 1-11%) compared with administration of loratadine alone. Cimetidine or ketoconazole plasma concentrations were unaffected by coadministration with loratadine. Despite increased concentrations of loratadine and DCL, there were no statistically significant differences for the primary electrocardiographic repolarization parameter (QTc) among any of the treatment groups. No other clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of loratadine were observed as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (mean (90% CI) QTc changes: loratadine vs loratadine + ketoconazole = 3.6 ms (-2.2, 9.4); loratadine vs loratadine + cimetidine = 3.2 ms (-1.6, 7.9)), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: Loratadine 10 mg daily was devoid of any effects on electrocardiographic parameters when coadministered for 10 days with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or cimetidine in healthy volunteers. It is concluded that, although there was a significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ketoconazole or cimetidine and loratadine, this effect was not accompanied by a change in the QTc interval in healthy adult volunteers.

A washout interval of 14 days separated regimens. The addition of loratadine did not statistically significantly affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin or its active metabolite, 14(R)-hydroxy-clarithromycin. However, the addition of clarithromycin statistically significantly altered the steady-state maximum observed plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a dosing interval for loratadine (+36 and +76%, respectively) and for descarboethoxyloratadine (DCL), the active metabolite of loratadine (+69 and +49%, respectively).

The mean clearance of diazepam was decreased 26% after omeprazole in the rapid metabolizers, whereas the slow group showed no apparent interaction. The mean plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam showed a more rapid formation in the rapid compared with the slow metabolizers, which is a logical consequence of the rate of diazepam metabolism. 2104790  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Relative to levels after administration of clopidogrel alone in studies 1,2,3, and 4, coadministration of PPI decreased the AUC(0-24) of the clopidogrel active metabolite H4 by 40, 47, 41, and 14% (P \u2264 0.002), respectively; increased maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) induced by 5 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by 8.0, 5.6, 8.1, and 4.3% (P \u2264 0.014), respectively; and increased the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation-platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI) by 20.7, 27.1, 19.0 (P < 0.0001), and 3.9% (P = 0.3319), respectively.

Omeprazole and clarithromycin are metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. This study aimed to elucidate whether clarithromycin affects the metabolism of omeprazole.METHODS: After administration of placebo or 400 mg clarithromycin twice a day for 3 days, 20 mg omeprazole and placebo or 400 mg clarithromycin were administered to 21 healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of omeprazole and clarithromycin and their metabolites were determined before and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 24 hours after dosing. CYP2C19 genotype status was determined by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.RESULTS: Subjects were classified into three groups on the basis of PCR-RFLP analyses for CYP2C19: homozygous extensive metabolizer group (n = 6), heterozygous extensive metabolizer group (n = 11), and poor metabolizer group (n = 4). Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 hours (AUC) of omeprazole in the homozygous extensive metabolizer, heterozygous extensive metabolizer, and poor metabolizer groups were significantly increased by clarithromycin from 383.9 to 813.1, from 1001.9 to 2110.4, and from 5589.7 to 13098.6 ng x h/mL, respectively. There were significant differences in the mean AUC values of clarithromycin among the three groups.CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin inhibits the metabolism of omeprazole. Drug interaction between clarithromycin and omeprazole may underlie high eradication rates achieved by triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. 10511062  2.

This combination may result in increased levels of omeprazole with potential interactions with commonly associated drugs. Kinetic/metabolic changes occurring after omeprazole/clarithromycin were compared to those occurring after pantoprazole/clarithromycin in healthy volunteers. Eight healthy volunteers, all males, age 25-34 years, all EM for CYP2C19, participated in a randomized, double blind crossover study in two periods of 7 days, separated by a 14-day washout. In each treatment period, subjects took either omeprazole 20mg b.i.d. together with clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., or pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d. with the same dose of the antibiotic. The pharmacokinetic parameters of omeprazole and pantoprazole were compared to those after intake of both agents alone. Kinetics of unchanged clarithromycin was evaluated at the end of the two periods. The mean value of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of unchanged omeprazole increased almost two-fold after concomitant administration of clarithromycin; the average 5-OH-omeprazole AUC was instead significantly reduced by 42%. Omeprazole clearance and volume of distribution were reduced significantly by 75 and 56%, respectively, after administration of the drug with clarithromicyn. No significant changes of the kinetic of pantoprazole and metabolites were observed. Kinetics of clarithromycin did not differ after the two associated treatments. The administration of clarithromycin with two different proton pump inhibitors indicates that the antibiotic can markedly increase omeprazole, not pantoprazole, levels. This observation may result in a better therapeutic response to omeprazole, but it may also potentially affect either the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates or interfere with the absorption of drugs requiring an intact gastric digestion system. 14998561  3.

Twenty healthy, Helicobacter pylori-negative male subjects completed this three-period, double-blind, randomized crossover study. In period 1, all subjects received 40 mg of omeprazole each morning for 6 days. Twenty-four-hour gastric pH monitoring took place on days -1 and 6. Pharmacokinetic sampling took place on day 6. In periods 2 and 3, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 40 mg of omeprazole or omeprazole placebo daily for 6 days plus clarithromycin (500 mg) every 8 h for 5 days with a single 500-mg dose on day 6. Gastric tissue and mucus samples were obtained via endoscopy on day 5. Gastric pH monitoring and pharmacokinetic sampling took place on day 6. Two-week washout intervals separated the three study periods. Clarithromycin increased mean omeprazole area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h from 3.3 +/- 2.0 to 6.3 +/- 4.5 micrograms.h/ml (P < 0.05) and harmonic mean half-life from 1.2 to 1.6 h (P < 0.05) but did not significantly alter the effect of omeprazole on gastric pH. Mean clarithromycin area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h increased from 22.9 +/- 5.5 (placebo) to 26.4 +/- 5.7 micrograms.h/ml (omeprazole) (P < 0.05) when clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole. Analysis of variance revealed that mean concentrations of clarithromycin in tissue and mucus were statistically significantly higher when clarithromycin was given with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was given with placebo (P <0.001). Mean maximum observed concentrations of clarithromycin in the gastric fundus increased from 20.8 +/- 7.6 (placebo) to 24.3 +/- 6.4 micrograms/g (omeprazole), and those in the gastric mucous from 4.2 +/- 7.7 placebo to 39.3 +/- 32.8 micrograms/g (omeprazole). Similar increases were observed for the 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin. These results show that omeprazole increases concentrations of clarithromycin in gastric tissue and mucus and may provide a mechanism for synergy between clarithromycin ad omeprazole that explains the excellent eradication of H. pylori seen in clinical trials.

In a randomized two-way crossover design a single dose of 1 mg digoxin was administered either alone (control) or on day 8 of an 11 day course of omeprazole 20 mg once daily. 3. Plasma digoxin concentrations were measured over 96 h after digoxin administration with a [125I]-r.i.a. method. 4. On average, Cmax and AUC values for digoxin were approximately 10% higher and tmax tended to be shorter during the administration of omeprazole, while the elimination rate constant was unaffected. 5. The increase in AUC(0,96 h) was statistically significant (P less than 0.05), but within the accepted range for bioequivalence. In two subjects the increase was approximately 30%. 6. It is concluded that co-treatment with omeprazole causes a minor increase in the absorption of oral digoxin. The magnitude of this effect is not considered to be clinically relevant for the majority of patients. PMC1368632PMID: 1954072  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

After seven days, the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of an 800-mg dose of indinavir alone or in combination with 200 mg of ritonavir was evaluated. Study participants received each of four study regimens in one of four randomly assigned orders. Blood samples were collected, and plasma indinavir and ritonavir concentrations were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.RESULTS: The coadministration of 20 or 40 mg of omeprazole with indinavir significantly reduced the mean indinavir area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) from 30.0 mg x hr/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.9-41.1 mg x hr/L) to 19.7 mg x hr/L (95% CI, 14.6-26.8 mg x hr/L) or 16.0 mg x hr/L (95% CI, 11.8-21.7 mg x hr/L), respectively (p < 0.002).

Intervention. Subjects received nelfinavir 1250 mg every 12 hours for 4 days (period 1). After a 7-day washout period, subjects were coadministered nelfinavir 1250 mg every 12 hours and omeprazole 40 mg every 24 hours for 4 days (period 2).MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir and its active metabolite M8 were determined on day 4 of both periods. Plasma samples were assayed by a high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method for nelfinavir and M8 concentrations, and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by using analytical software. In the presence of omeprazole, nelfinavir area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC(tau)), maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max)), and minimum observed plasma concentration (C(min)) were reduced by an average of 36%, 37%, and 39%, respectively, relative to administration of nelfinavir alone. The AUC(tau), C(max), and C(min) of M8 were reduced by an average of 92%, 89%, and 75%, respectively. The slopes of the terminal elimination phase of nelfinavir and M8 plasma concentration-time curves were similar between treatments. Nelfinavir was well tolerated when administered alone and when coadministered with omeprazole.CONCLUSION: The observed reduction in the systemic exposure to both nelfinavir and its active metabolite M8 after coadministration with omeprazole could result in loss of virologic control and potential emergence of drug resistance.

No clinically significant interactions between saquinavir absorption and gastric pH have previously been shown. We evaluated the effect of omeprazole, a proton-pump-inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of the recently developed saquinavir-500 mg formulation co-administered with ritonavir.METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects (n = 6 women and 12 men) received 1000/100 mg saquinavir/ritonavir twice daily in an open-label study for 15 days. On days 11-15, subjects were administered omeprazole 40 mg daily with the morning dose. Serial plasma samples were collected for 12-h pharmacokinetic profiles of saquinavir and ritonavir on days 10 and 15 and safety analysis on days 1, 4, 10, 15 and 29.RESULTS: The geometric mean and 95% confidence interval (CI), for the area under time-concentration curve (AUC; ng h/ml), trough plasma concentration (C trough; ng/ml) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax; ng/ml) of saquinavir were 20599 (14396-29360) and 37511 (28733-48970); 737 (482-1127) and 1521 (1039-2227); 3227 (2370-4393) and 5611 (4507-7710) on days 10 and 15, respectively, with geometric mean ratios of 1.82, 2.06 and 1.75. No significant changes were observed in saquinavir elimination half life, ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters or in safety laboratory tests. No unexpected adverse events attributed to study medication were noted.CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of omeprazole, total saquinavir plasma exposure is significantly increased (82% increase in AUC). The mechanism of this interaction requires elucidation. Despite the significant increase in saquinavir exposure, no short term toxicities were observed. 16791014  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Single 20 mg doses of omeprazole were given orally on day -7, day 1, and day 7. Single doses of artemisinin and omeprazole were given in combination on day 14 after a 6-day washout period. The pharmacokinetics of artemisinin, omeprazole, hydroxyomeprazole, and omeprazole sulfone were evaluated on days -7, 1, 7, and 14. On the same days urine was collected for the determination of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and cortisol excretion.RESULTS: Areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) for artemisinin and omeprazole decreased on day 7 to 20% (95% confidence intervals, 13%, 28%) and 35% (25%, 46%), respectively, compared with values on day AUC ratios for hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole increased 2.2-fold (1.7, 2.7) on day 7 compared with values on day All values were normalized at day 14. There were no significant changes in the omeprazole sulfone/omeprazole ratio or in the 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio between the study days. In one subject found to have poor CYP2C19 metabolization, the elimination of omeprazole increased after artemisinin exposure, with no change in the hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole AUC ratio.CONCLUSION: Artemisinin did not alter CYP3A4 activity, whereas an increase in CYP2C19 activity was observed. The increased elimination of omeprazole in both poor and extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers suggests artemisinin induces both CYP2C19 and another enzyme. 9728896  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

The inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19 as well as CYP1A2, on the metabolism of omeprazole was compared between different genotypes for CYP2C19.METHODS: Eighteen volunteers, of whom six were homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs), six were heterozygous EMs and six were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed. All subjects received two six-day courses of either daily 50 mg fluvoxamine or placebo in a randomized fashion with a single oral 40 mg dose of omeprazole on day six in both cases. Plasma concentrations of omeprazole and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulphone, and fluvoxamine were monitored up to 8 h after the dosing.RESULTS: During placebo administration, geometric means of peak concentration (C(max)), under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h (AUC(0,8 h)) and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of omeprazole were 900 ng ml(-1), 1481 ng ml(-1) h, and 0.6 h in homozygous EMs, 1648 ng ml(-1), 4225 ng ml(-1) h, and 1.1 h in heterozygous EMs, and 2991 ng ml(-1), 11537 ng ml(-1) h, and 2.8 h in PMs, respectively. Fluvoxamine treatment increased C(max) of omeprazole by 3.7-fold (95%CI, 2.4, 5.0-fold, P < 0.01) and 2.0-fold (1.4, 2.6-fold, P < 0.01), AUC(0,8 h) by 6.0-fold (3.3, 8.7-fold, P < 0.001) and 2.4-fold (1.7, 3.2-fold, P < 0.01), AUC(0, infinity ) by 6.2-fold (3.0, 9.3-fold, P < 0.01) and 2.5-fold (1.6, 3.4-fold, P < 0.001) and prolonged t((1/2)) by 2.6-fold (1.9, 3.4-fold, P < 0.001) and 1.4-fold (1.02, 1.7-fold, P < 0.05), respectively. However, no pharmacokinetic parameters were changed in PMs. The AUC(0,8 h) ratios of 5-hydroxyomeprazole to omeprazole were decreased with fluvoxamine in homozygous EMs (P < 0.05) and heterozygous EMs (P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Even a low dose of fluvoxamine increased omeprazole exposure in EMs, but did not increase omeprazole exposure in PMs after a single oral dose of omeprazole. These findings confirm a potent inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on CYP2C19 activity. The bioavailability of omeprazole might, to some extent, be increased through inhibition of P-glycoprotein during fluvoxamine treatment.

Sulfoxidation may be the predominant pathway in individuals devoid of the genetically determined CYP2C19 activity. Ketoconazole is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor in daily doses from 200 to 400 mg. In this study ketoconazole was used as a probe to investigate the extent to which CYP3A4 is involved in omeprazole metabolism in vivo.METHODS: A single oral 20 mg dose of omeprazole before and after four daily doses of 200, 100, or 50 mg ketoconazole was given to 10 healthy subjects, previously phenotyped as poor or extensive metabolizers of S-mephenytoin. Concentrations of omeprazole, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulfone, and ketoconazole were analyzed with reversed-phase HPLC methods in plasma samples collected repeatedly for 12 hours after dosing.RESULTS: After intake of 20 mg omeprazole with 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg ketoconazole, mean values for omeprazole sulfone area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 6 hours [AUC(0-6)] were 482, 206, 167, and < 100 nmol/L.hr in extensive metabolizers and 3160, 2430, 937, and 534 nmol/L.hr in poor metabolizers, respectively. Mean omeprazole AUC(0-6) increased from 1660 to 2265 nmol/L.hr in extensive metabolizers and from 7715 to 15319 nmol/L.hr in poor metabolizers after intake of 200 mg ketoconazole.CONCLUSIONS: An oral daily dose of 100 to 200 mg ketoconazole is sufficient to provide a marked inhibition of the formation of the omeprazole sulfone in both extensive and poor metabolizers and leads to a doubling of omeprazole levels in poor metabolizers, whereas 50 mg ketoconazole provides only partial inhibition. We concluded that CYP3A4 catalyzes the sulfoxidation of omeprazole and that this is the predominant metabolic pathway of omeprazole in poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin. 9357389  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Venous blood samples were collected for 24 h after oral ingestion of 40 mg omeprazole with or without 300 mg moclobemide coadministration. The pharmacokinetic change of omeprazole, omeprazole sulphone and 5-hydroxyomeprazole concentrations were assessed to test for an interaction between omeprazole and moclobemide.RESULTS: The coadministration of moclobemide in EMs approximately doubled the mean AUC (from 1834 to 3760 ng ml(-1) h) and C(max) (from 987 to 1649 ng ml(-1)) of omeprazole, and increased the AUC of omeprazole sulphone without changing AUC ratio of omeprazole to omeprazole sulphone. Moclobemide coadministration more than doubled the AUC ratio of omeprazole to 5-hydroxyomeprazole (from 2.5 to 5.3) in EMs, too. There was a significant decrease in Cmax and AUC of 5-hydroxyomeprazole in PMs but no significant changes were seen in the results for omeprazole and omeprazole sulphone AUCs.CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of moclobemide resulted in significant suppression of CYP2C19 activity in EMs. We conclude that physicians prescribing moclobemide should pay attention to its pharmacokinetic interactions even on the first day of coadministration with CYP2C19 substrates.

Plasma concentrations of omeprazole were determined over a 24-hour period following drug administration, by a validated RP-HPLC method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with compartmental and non-compartmental analysis, using the computer program Kinetica (Inna Phase). In the two periods of treatments, the mean peak plasma concentrations Cmax were 730.8 ng/ml for omeprazole alone and 802.1 ng/ml for omeprazole co-administered with ranitidine (not significant).

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of omeprazole (a CYP2C19 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100 mg oral dose of cilostazol.DESIGN: This study was conducted as a single-centre, open-label, nonrandomised, 2-period, crossover pharmacokinetic trial. A single 100 mg dose of cilostazol was administered orally on days 0 and 14. Oral omeprazole (40 mg every day) was administered on days 7 to 18.STUDY PARTICIPANTS: 20 healthy nonsmoking male and female volunteers.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serial blood samples were collected before and after cilostazol administration to characterise the pharmacokinetics of cilostazol and its metabolites.RESULTS: Following omeprazole coadministration, the increases in cilostazol maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at time t (AUCt) were 18% (p = 0.062) and 26% (p < 0.001), respectively. For the 2 major circulating metabolites, OPC-13015 and OPC-13213, the OPC-13015 Cmax and AUCt increased by 29 and 69%, respectively (p < 0.001). However, for OPC-13213, the Cmax and AUCt decreased by 22 and 31%, respectively (p < 0.001). The plasma protein binding of cilostazol was unaffected by coadministration of omeprazole.CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of cilostazol with omeprazole resulted in an increase in the systemic exposure of cilostazol and its active metabolite, OPC-13015, by 26 and 69%, respectively. For the other active metabolite, OPC-13213, systemic exposure decreased by 31% because of inhibition of cilostazol metabolism to this metabolite. These changes in systemic exposure were well tolerated. A dose of 50 mg cilostazol twice a day should be considered during coadministration of inhibitors of CYP2C19, such as omeprazole. 10702887  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Omeprazole is a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor.WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study indicates that omeprazole induces a loss of enantioselectivity in the CITA pharmacokinetics because of the selective inhibition of (+)-(S)-CITA metabolism.AIM: The study assessed the influence of omeprazole on the kinetic disposition of the (+)-(S)-citalopram (CITA) and (-)-(R)-CITA enantiomers in healthy volunteers.METHODS: In a cross-over study, healthy volunteers (n = 9) phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 and with an oral midazolam clearance ranging from 10.9 to 149.3 ml min(-1) kg(-1) received a single dose of racemic CITA (20 mg orally) in combination or not with omeprazole (20 mg day(-1) for 18 days). Serial blood samples were collected up to 240 h after CITA administration. CITA and demethylcitalopram (DCITA) enantiomers were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Chiralcel OD-R column.RESULTS: The kinetic disposition of CITA was enantioselective in the absence of treatment with omeprazole, with the observation of a greater proportion of plasma (-)-(R)-CITA [AUC S:R ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.41, 0.66) for CITA and 1.08 (95% CI 0.80, 1.76) for DCITA] than (+)-(S)-CITA. Racemic CITA administration to healthy volunteers in combination with omeprazole showed a loss of enantioselectivity in CITA pharmacokinetics with an increase of approximately 120% in plasma (+)-(S)-CITA concentrations [AUC S:R ratio of 0.95 (95% CI 0.72, 1.10) for CITA and 0.95 (95% CI 0.44, 1.72) for DCITA].CONCLUSIONS: The administration of multiple doses of omeprazole preferentially inhibited (+)-(S)-CITA metabolism in healthy volunteers. Although omeprazole increased plasma concentrations of (+)-(S)-CITA by approximately 120%, it is difficult to evaluate the clinical outcome because the range of plasma CITA concentrations related to maximum efficacy and minimum risk of adverse effects has not been established.

Proton pump inhibitors and H(2)-antagonists are frequently used in the HIV-negative-infected population, and drug-drug interactions have been described with other antiretrovirals. This study evaluated the effect of steady-state omeprazole and ranitidine on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of etravirine.METHODS: In an open-label, randomized, one-way, three-period crossover trial, HIV-negative volunteers randomly received a single dose of 100 mg etravirine alone (treatment A); 11 days of 150 mg ranitidine b.i.d. (treatment B); and 11 days of 40 mg omeprazole q.d. (treatment C). A single dose of 100 mg etravirine was co-administered on day 8 of sessions 2 and 3. Each session was separated by a 14-day wash-out.RESULTS: Nineteen volunteers (seven female) participated. When a single dose of etravirine was administered in the presence of steady-state ranitidine, etravirine least squares means ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC(last) and C(max) were 0.86 (0.76, 0.97) and 0.94 (0.75, 1.17), respectively, compared with administration of etravirine alone. When administered with steady-state omeprazole, these values were 1.41 (1.22, 1.62) and 1.17 (0.96, 1.43), respectively. Co-administration of a single dose of etravirine and ranitidine or omeprazole was generally safe and well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Ranitidine slightly decreased etravirine exposure, whereas omeprazole increased it by approximately 41%. The increased exposure of etravirine when co-administered with omeprazole is attributed to CYP2C19 inhibition. Considering the favourable safety profile of etravirine, these changes are not clinically relevant. Etravirine can be co-administered with proton pump inhibitors and H(2) antagonists without dose adjustments. PMC2561103PMID: 18492125  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

The patient's serum creatinine and liver function tests were normal during treatment and follow-up. The only medication we suspected of inhibiting MTX elimination was omeprazole 20 mg every 12 hours. Twenty-four hours after the first high-dose MTX cycle (15 g), omeprazole was discontinued. Thereafter, the patient received one high-dose MTX cycle without omeprazole every month for five months; MTX elimination was normal throughout MTX cycles 2 to 5.DISCUSSION: MTX is actively secreted in the distal tubules. The renal hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K(+)-ATPase) pump makes the urine more acidic, by secreting hydrogen ions into the renal tubule and reabsorbing potassium ions. Active tubular secretion of MTX requires the activity of this pump because MTX is excreted with hydrogen ions. Omeprazole can inhibit renal elimination of the hydrogen ion and block the active tubular secretion of MTX. Therefore, the elimination half-life of MTX increases, which may result in potentially toxic concentrations of MTX. At a pH of approximately 5, as found in the renal tubules, pantoprazole is more slowly activated than omeprazole, reducing the incidence of unwanted reactions with sulfhydryl groups and adverse effects occurring outside of the gastric hydrogen pump.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the Naranjo probability scale, a probable drug interaction was observed. Omeprazole may delay MTX elimination; therefore, when prescribing MTX, an alternative to omeprazole should be considered. 10981249  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

However, the relative contribution of each enzyme to proguanil bioactivation to cycloguanil and to the metabolism of omeprazole, as well as their potential to interact, remains to be examined. The bioactivation of proguanil to its active metabolite cycloguanil was studied in vitro in human liver microsomes and in vivo in 12 healthy subjects, in the absence and in the presence of omeprazole. The formation of cycloguanil from proguanil exhibited biphasic kinetic behavior in four of six human livers, indicating that at least two enzymes are responsible for this metabolic step. Cycloguanil formation activity did not correlate with immunoreactive CYP3A4 content or with CYP3A4 activity, as measured by testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation, suggesting that CYP3A4 plays a limited role in cycloguanil formation. Furthermore, troleandomycin (10 microM) inhibited only 10 to 17% of cycloguanil formation at proguanil concentrations of 100 and 500 microM. At a proguanil concentration of 20 microM, omeprazole at 10 microM inhibited cycloguanil formation in vitro by 47 +/- 59%. These in vitro results were consistent with the results of our in vivo study in healthy subjects, which showed a 32 +/- 11% decrease in proguanil apparent oral clearance and a 65 +/- 8% decrease in proguanil partial metabolic clearance to cycloguanil in the presence of omeprazole (both P < .001). We conclude that in vitro studies of proguanil metabolism and interactions are predictive of in vivo situations, that CYP2C19 is the main enzyme responsible for proguanil bioactivation to cycloguanil and that omeprazole inhibits this biotransformation in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting this enzyme.PMID: 9023285  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

The concentration/dose (C/D) ratio for tacrolimus was markedly higher during the period of treatment with omeprazole than ranitidine or rabeprazole. The results of liver functional tests were within the normal range during the use of these three antacid drugs. Since the higher C/D ratio for tacrolimus when omeprazole was being administered did not result from a decrease in the elimination of tacrolimus due to hepatic dysfunction, drug interaction between omeprazole and tacrolimus was strongly suspected. The present case indicates that rabeprazole can be used safely in place of omeprazole in kidney transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus. 18159131  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Promethazine, 150 mg/d, in 11 patients and homochlorcyclizine, 60 mg/d, in the others were coadministered for at least 1 week. Blood sampling was performed before and during coadministration of promethazine or homochlorcyclizine and 1 week after the discontinuation, together with clinical assessments by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Udvalg for kliniske undersogelser (UKU) side effect rating scale. The Css (mean +/- SD) of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol during promethazine coadministration (27.6 +/- 24.9 and 8.6 +/- 13.2 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those before the coadministration (12.7 +/- 10.8 and 5.0 +/- 6.0 ng/mL; P < 0.01) or 1 week after the discontinuation (15.6 +/- 14.8 and 5.8 +/- 7.9 ng/mL; P < 0.05). The Css of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol during homochlorcyclizine coadministration (14.9 +/- 8.1 and 6.4 +/- 5.4 ng/mL) were also significantly higher than those before the coadministration (10.9 +/- 7.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.6 ng/mL; P < 0.01) or 1 week after the discontinuation (12.9 +/- 7.4 and 4.8 +/- 4.1 ng/mL; P < 0.05). No change in BPRS or UKU score was found throughout the study. Thus, the current study suggests that coadministration of clinical doses of promethazine and homochlorcyclizine increases the Css of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol via the inhibitory effects on the CYP2D6-catalyzed metabolism of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol. 12657913  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

When taken as oral tablets, ropinirole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, and it is extensively distributed from the vascular compartment. The bioavailability is approximately 50%. Ropinirole shows low plasma protein binding. The drug is inactivated by metabolism in the liver, and none of the major circulating metabolites have pharmacological activity. The principal metabolic enzyme is the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP1A2. Ropinirole shows approximately linear pharmacokinetics when given as single or repeated doses, and is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 6 hours. Population pharmacokinetics have demonstrated that gender, mild or moderate renal impairment, Parkinson's disease stage and concomitant illnesses or the use of several common concomitant medications have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole. Clearance is slower for patients older than 65 years compared with those who are younger, and in women taking hormone replacement therapy compared with those who are not. The CYP1A2 inhibitor ciprofloxacin produced increases in the plasma concentrations of ropinirole when these 2 drugs were coadministered, but no interaction was seen with theophylline which, like ropinirole, is also a substrate for CYP1A2. There is no obvious plasma concentration-effect relationship for ropinirole. 11069211  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}

Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure. Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects. Compared with pravastatin alone, coadministration of verapamil, mibefradil, or itraconazole with pravastatin was associated with no significant changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics. However, concomitant verapamil increased the simvastatin area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite simvastatin acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p <0.001). Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a >60% increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of atorvastatin were observed when coadministered with mibefradil. The half-life of atorvastatin also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with itraconazole, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of atorvastatin and a 47% increase in the AUC (p <0.001 for C(max) and AUC). Clarithromycin significantly (p <0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly simvastatin ( approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (12-fold), followed by atorvastatin (greater than fourfold) and then pravastatin (almost twofold).

We studied possible interactions of itraconazole with simvastatin and pravastatin.METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover studies were performed with use of an identical design, one with simvastatin (study I) and one with pravastatin (study II). In both studies, 10 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin (study I) or pravastatin (study II). Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, pravastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined.RESULTS: In study I, itraconazole increased the peak serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of simvastatin and simvastatin acid at least tenfold (p < 0.001). The Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of total simvastatin acid (naive simvastatin acid plus that derived by hydrolysis of the lactone) were increased 17-fold and 19-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the half-life (t1/2) was increased by 25% (p < 0.05). The AUC(0-infinity) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased fivefold (p < 0.001) and the Cmax and t1/2 were increased threefold (p < 0.001). In study II, itraconazole slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of pravastatin, but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively). The t1/2 was not altered. The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p < 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by itraconazole. There were no differences in the serum concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole between studies I and II.CONCLUSIONS: Itraconazole greatly increased serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism, but it had only a minor effect on pravastatin.

We studied the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered simvastatin.METHODS: In a randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took either 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice or water 3 times a day for 2 days. On day 3, each subject ingested 60 mg simvastatin with either 200 mL grapefruit juice or water, and an additional 200 mL was ingested 1/2 and 1 1/2 hours after simvastatin administration. Serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and those of active (naive) and total (after hydrolysis) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by a radioenzyme inhibition assay.RESULTS: Grapefruit juice increased the mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged simvastatin about 9-fold (range, 5.1-fold to 31.4-fold; P < .01) and the mean area under the serum simvastatin concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 16-fold (range, 9.0-fold to 37.7-fold; P < .05). The mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin acid were both increased about 7-fold (P < .01). Grapefruit juice increased the mean AUC(0-infinity) of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 2.4-fold (P < .01) and 3.6-fold (P < .01), respectively. The time of the peak concentration of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased by grapefruit juice (P < .05).CONCLUSION: Grapefruit juice greatly increased serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and, to a lesser extent, those of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The probable mechanism of this interaction was inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of simvastatin by grapefruit juice in the small intestine.

Twelve young, healthy volunteers took orally either 1.5 gm/day erythromycin, 240 mg/day verapamil, or placebo for 2 days. On day 2, 40 mg simvastatin was administered orally. Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, erythromycin, verapamil, and norverapamil were measured for up to 24 hours.RESULTS: Erythromycin and verapamil increased mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged simvastatin 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.05) and the area under the serum simvastatin concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] 6.2-fold (p < 0.001) and 4.6-fold (p < 0.01).

Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been associated with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis is a rare adverse event associated with this class of drugs, their prevalent use in the management of dyslipidemia makes it increasingly important for clinicians to understand the nature of this condition. Rhabdomyolysis can occur with all statins when used alone and particularly when combined with other drugs that are themselves myotoxic or that elevate the concentration of the statin. Statins are particularly susceptible to the latter effect because of their metabolism by the CYP450 system and their low oral bioavailability.

Due to recurrent atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon and antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone were initiated. Four weeks after starting simvastatin 40 mg/day and 2 weeks after initiating amiodarone 1 g/day for 10 days, then 200 mg/day, he developed diffuse muscle pain with generalized muscular weakness. Laboratory investigations revealed a significant increase of creatine kinase (CK) peaking at 40 392 U/L. Due to a suspected drug interaction of simvastatin with amiodarone, both drugs were stopped. CK normalized over the following 8 days, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was probably related to simvastatin.DISCUSSION: Myopathy is a rare but potentially severe adverse reaction associated with statins. Besides high statin doses, concomitant use of fibrates, defined comorbidities, and concurrent use of inhibitors of cytochrome P450 are important additional risk factors. This is especially relevant if statins predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 are combined with inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Amiodarone is a potent inhibitor of several different CYP isoenzymes, including CYP3A4.CONCLUSIONS: Avoiding the concomitant use of drugs with the potential to inhibit CYP-dependent metabolism (eg, amiodarone) or elimination of statins may decrease the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Alternatively, if drug therapy with a potent CYP inhibitor is inevitable, choosing a statin without relevant CYP metabolism (eg, pravastatin) should be considered. 15069169  ", "ideal": {"DDI-triples": ""}, "task": 3}
